The moment you run the project to the customer's computer is an uneasy timespan. There is no time to find a bug. All things should be perfect. However, things usually do not go the best way, and you see some red lights.

I developed software with .NET 6 for a company. They said I should go and install it on their systems, so I generated a setup and set the deployment mode on publish settings to Self-contained. Everything should be okay; I install a setup installer and get my bill after that. However, their system windows were a doom. Because It was a windows 7 with no updates after the first release, I will show you the errors that doomed me in this post and how I solved them.

# The program can't start because api-ms-win-crt-string-l1-1-0.dll is missing.

This error was my first and most shocking. Because I checked on other computers, and I checked the produce single file setting on the publish settings, so I should not have any problems with missing DLLs. I found out this system missed one update with the name KB2999226(to find more detail about it, check this [link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/update-for-universal-c-runtime-in-windows-c0514201-7fe6-95a3-b0a5-287930f3560c)). You can find and install this update on [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/update-for-universal-c-runtime-in-windows-c0514201-7fe6-95a3-b0a5-287930f3560c), and the error will fix.

## System.TypeInitializationException: The type initializer for 'System.DateTime' threw an exception.

After the last error was fixed, I thought everything was okay and It was time to get my billüòÅüòÅüòÅ. But this error showed out.

This error was confusing because I had thought my code had bugs, and I got a big bug. However, when I searched, I found this bug is impossible, so I must think of other possibilities. I found out this computer missed two updates too.

These updates are required to run the .NET 6 app on windows, but Microsoft does not highlight these updates. these updates on windows 7 are `Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2019 Redistributable` and `KB3063858` .you can find and download these updates on [this page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/windows?tabs=net60#additional-deps).
