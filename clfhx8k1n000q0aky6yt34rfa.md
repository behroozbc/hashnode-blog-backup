Today is the first day of the Persian Calendar which is the start day of the Nowruz holiday. Nowruz has been celebrated since [Cyrus the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_the_Great).

During this time, people have a great time to relax, study, and see their family and friends, to start a better year than the previous year.

I suggest you watch Mickey mouse to know and see the Nowruz rituals and ceremonies.

In the end, As every year, I wish anyone a great year without any sickness and achieves his or her dreams. I hope this year I have more time to write blogs. If you have any suggestions for this year, please comment them.
